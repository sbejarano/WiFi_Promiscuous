## Data Symlinks Directory

This folder contains **symbolic links (symlinks)** to the **live data generated by system services**.  
The actual files are written by their respective services, and this directory provides **stable, read-only access points** for dashboards, scripts, and external consumers.

### GPS Service
- **gps.json**  
  Live GNSS position, fix status, timing, and metadata produced by the GPS service.

### System Service
- **system.json**  
  Host health and runtime status (uptime, load, service state, etc.).

### Wireless Capture Services
- **wifi_directional.json**  
  Aggregated directional analysis derived from LEFT/RIGHT scanners.

- **wifi_node_1.json** … **wifi_node_12.json**  
  Per-node wireless capture output from each fixed scanning node.

- **wifi_node_LEFT.json**  
  Logical LEFT-side directional view (derived, not a physical node).

- **wifi_node_RIGHT.json**  
  Logical RIGHT-side directional view (derived, not a physical node).

### Design Notes
- Services write data to **protected service-owned locations**
- This directory exposes **consistent filenames** via symlinks
- Consumers do not need to know where services actually write data
- Services can restart, rotate files, or change paths without breaking consumers

### Important
**Do not write to or modify files in this directory.**  
All files here are **symlinks maintained by running services** and must be treated as **read-only**.
